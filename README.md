This is my 2nd project (2024) LOL ls -a  If you read my "1st-project-ever-(2020)," I mentioned that I started coding in 2020 when I was looking to make a mini app that tracks my reps when working out. When I made it and finished, I couldn't turn it into an app to use it on my phone. That was a big disappointment back then, and was one of the reasons I stopped learning..., After 4 years, LOL, and after a lot of experiences in life, I decided to come back and take it seriously. I started a new learning journey, and this is a mini project for a profile card that I made using HTML and CSS. I'm doing this type of mini project just to practice what I'm learning ls -a!  Of course, it won't be perfect, and I expect that it might not adhere to the best practices, but this is just the beginning of something very big, LOL!
